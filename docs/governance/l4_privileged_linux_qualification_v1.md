# L4 Privileged Linux Qualification Fixture Contract V1

## 1. Design Status and Authority

DESIGN / GOVERNANCE ONLY. This document freezes the design of the privileged
Linux qualification fixture for the L4 trading-day schedule artifact reader. It
implements no runtime, adds no test, changes no workflow, mutates no registry
and qualifies no platform tuple. Everything below describes work that a later,
separately authorized implementation PR must perform.

```text
DESIGN_ONLY=true
IMPLEMENTATION_AUTHORIZED=false
PRIVILEGED_EXECUTION_AUTHORIZED=false
CI_WORKFLOW_CHANGE_AUTHORIZED=false
PRODUCTION_CHANGE_AUTHORIZED=false
REGISTRY_ADMISSION_AUTHORIZED=false
MERGE_AUTHORIZED=false
DESIGN_DOCUMENT_AUTHORIZED=true
```

This design incorporates the corrections recorded by the independent A3
discovery review:

```text
A3_DISCOVERY_INDEPENDENT_REVIEW=PASS_WITH_CORRECTIONS
```

The corrections are normative here, not commentary:

- 0644 mode semantics are stated exactly; the fixture MUST NOT claim that the
  post-chown privileged owner is non-writable, and MUST NOT use 0600.
- The remaining RQP-L17 row is restated as representation drift, not as a
  proven statx mount-id change.
- `L105` remains a defensive fail-closed invariant; its real trigger is not
  known constructible.
- No file-descriptor-passing-via-sudo mechanism is frozen, because its
  implementability is not proved.
- The existing `ci.yml` formal topology is preserved exactly; privileged
  qualification is a separate workflow.

Scope of this PR is exactly one new document:

```text
ADDED_FILE=docs/governance/l4_privileged_linux_qualification_v1.md
FORBIDDEN_CHANGES=src/**,tests/**,scripts/**,.github/**,ci/**,AGENTS.md
EXECUTABLE_PRIVILEGED_CODE=0
```

The design is the predecessor authority for a later implementation PR. That
implementation PR's base commit MUST already contain this document unchanged.
Material redesign of any frozen token requires another design-only review before
implementation; the frozen tokens are not advisory.

## 2. Exact Base Record

The checked-in Exact Base procedure
([DEVELOPMENT_PLAYBOOK.md](DEVELOPMENT_PLAYBOOK.md) section 1.1,
[AGENT_HANDOFF.md](AGENT_HANDOFF.md) rule 3) was executed for this PR: switch
`main`, fresh fetch of `origin` with prune and tags, `pull --ff-only`, then
verification of `HEAD`, `origin/main`, tree and tracked worktree state.

```text
BASE_MAIN_SHA=7fc8c1395d01bc4f612291fcdf098703a3866dcd
BASE_MAIN_TREE=bc9ac7c846b271eb48adce1a0343276983e1008c
BASE_HEAD_EQUALS_ORIGIN_MAIN=true
TRACKED_WORKTREE_CLEAN=true
```

Transport record. The HTTPS transport on this host fails with
`schannel: AcquireCredentialsHandle failed: SEC_E_NO_CREDENTIALS
(0x8009030e)`. That failure does not waive the procedure. Remote truth was
established through the reviewed confined SSH transport:

- an environment-local `GIT_SSH` shim stored outside every repository and
  worktree, invoking exactly
  `C:/Windows/System32/OpenSSH/ssh.exe` with
  `-i C:/Users/Administrator/.ssh/marketvault_github_ed25519_v2`,
  `-o IdentitiesOnly=yes`, `-o BatchMode=yes`,
  `-o StrictHostKeyChecking=yes` and
  `-o UserKnownHostsFile=C:/Users/Administrator/.ssh/known_hosts`;
- `GIT_SSH_VARIANT=ssh` in the same environment so the shim is driven as the
  OpenSSH client it wraps;
- a command-local URL rewrite
  `-c url.ssh://git@github.com/.insteadOf=https://github.com/` for the
  `origin` commands
  (`git ... fetch origin --prune --tags` and
  `git ... pull --ff-only origin main`), so `remote.origin.url` is never
  modified;
- no `GIT_SSH_COMMAND`, no `git remote set-url`, no persistent git
  configuration mutation, no host-key relaxation.

Governance note. An earlier discovery invocation reached the same state with
`fetch` plus `merge --ff-only` after transport recovery. That substitution is
NOT promoted into the development procedure. The standing requirement is the
checked-in sequence with real `pull --ff-only` semantics, which is what this PR
executed.

## 3. Frozen Production Surface

This design is a contract about specific existing guards. The following facts
are the entire production surface it binds; no other production behavior is
covered, and none of it is changed.

| Symbol | Location | Frozen behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `_permissions` owner policy | `src/market_vault/schedule_artifact/_linux.py` L109-L118, owner guard at L110 | `_require(data.st_uid in (0, os.geteuid()), "UNSAFE_PATH", "untrusted Linux object owner")` |
| `_permissions` mutation policy | same, L111-L113 | group/world write bits (`st_mode & 0o022`) are rejected unless the object is a sticky directory acting as an ancestor |
| `_permissions` attribute policy | same, L114-L117 | any POSIX ACL or any extended attribute is rejected as unqualified |
| `_mount_id` | same, L53-L60 | real `statx` mount/inode identity; requires the mount-id mask bit, nonzero mount id and nonzero inode, else `PLATFORM_UNQUALIFIED` |
| `_mount_description` | same, L72-L95 | bounded complete mount table, one `-` separator per record, `separator >= 6`, exactly three fields after the separator; `PLATFORM_UNQUALIFIED` detail `held mount missing or ambiguous` when the held mount id matches zero or several records (L84-L85) |
| `_mount_description` ext4/root/device rule | same, L88-L90 | matching record field 2 equals the observed device, field 3 is exactly `/`, the filesystem type is exactly `ext4`, and that device appears in exactly one record of the whole table, else `PLATFORM_UNQUALIFIED` detail `non-ext4 or bind-mount ambiguity` |
| `_mount_description` write policy | same, L93-L94 | `rw` must be present in the mount options and in the super options, and `ro` must be absent from both, else `PLATFORM_UNQUALIFIED` detail `read-only mount` |
| `_ext4_capability` | same, L98-L106 | `fstat(fd)`, first `_mount_id(fd)`, real `/proc/self/mountinfo` read, `_mount_description(...)`, then the L105 drift recheck; returns `("ext4", mount_options, super_options)` |
| `L105` drift invariant | same, L105 | `_require(_mount_id(fd) == before, "UNSAFE_PATH", "mount identity drift")` — a defensive fail-closed invariant |
| `_LinuxObject` | same, L121-L175 | no-follow retained descriptor opened with `O_RDONLY\|O_NOFOLLOW\|O_CLOEXEC\|O_NONBLOCK` (L130), single-link regular files only (L145), retained facts `(identity, filesystem, security, size)` (L141-L147), `recheck()` re-derives and re-opens the same path (L149-L156) |
| `_NativeScope` ancestry binding | `src/market_vault/schedule_artifact/_physical.py` L32-L42 | every retained ancestor from the filesystem root down to the artifact parent must carry an identical filesystem tuple, else `UNSAFE_PATH` detail `ancestry mount/volume transition` (L37-L38); Linux additionally requires the `0xef53` ext4 magic (L41) and computes `mount_description` through `_ext4_capability` (L42) |
| `_NativeScope.recheck` | same, L69-L72 | `_ext4_capability` must reproduce the retained mount description, else `PHYSICAL_DRIFT` detail `mount description changed` |
| L4 capability registry | `src/market_vault/schedule_artifact/_platform.py` L10 | `_QUALIFIED_CAPABILITIES = frozenset()` |
| L4 capability assembly | same, L22-L33 | the ten-field Linux tuple, whose eighth field is the `_ext4_capability` triple and whose ninth field is `l4-schedule-readonly-statx-ext4-v1` |
| L4 admission | same, L37-L40 | exact membership in `_QUALIFIED_CAPABILITIES`, else `PLATFORM_UNQUALIFIED` detail `unqualified exact L4 native capability: ...` |
| Reason vocabulary | `src/market_vault/schedule_artifact/_errors.py` L4-L11 | `UNSAFE_PATH`, `PLATFORM_UNQUALIFIED` and `PHYSICAL_DRIFT` are admitted reason codes |
| Error transport | same, L14-L26 | `_ScheduleArtifactError.reason_code` is an attribute; the message is `reason_code + ": " + detail` |

Existing ordinary evidence surface, which this design extends without editing:

| Surface | Location | Current state |
| --- | --- | --- |
| RQP-L09 case registry | `tests/test_schedule_artifact_native_guards.py` L1351-L1366 | twelve declared cases; `XATTR`, `POSIX_ACL`, `FOREIGN_OWNER`, `ROOT_OWNED` are the conditional gap cases |
| RQP-L09 ownership fixture | same, L1747-L1768 | real `os.chown`, no privilege escalation, kernel refusal recorded verbatim as a gap |
| RQP-L09 foreign/root cases | same, L1772-L1803 | expect `UNSAFE_PATH` / `untrusted Linux object owner` and `held.security[0] == 0` |
| RQP-L17 status | same, L1820-L1871 | `GAP`; read-only feasibility probe, zero mount operations |
| Privilege static guards | same, L2954-L3008 | no sudo/doas/pkexec, no installer, `chown` confined to the ownership helper, feasibility probe stays read-only |
| L4 candidate tuple | `tests/test_schedule_artifact_platform.py` | ten-field literal, temporary enrollment only, production registry asserted empty (L272-L276) |
| Ordinary collection scope | `pyproject.toml` `[tool.pytest.ini_options]` | `testpaths = ["tests"]` with default `python_files = test_*.py` |
| Formal CI topology | `.github/workflows/ci.yml` | exactly three formal jobs: `test`, `portability-pyarrow24`, `package` |

## 4. Freeze: RQP-L09 Foreign-Owner and Root-Owned Cases

```text
RQP_L09_FOREIGN_OWNER_TARGET=_permissions owner-policy rejection
RQP_L09_ROOT_OWNED_TARGET=_permissions literal uid-0 admission with geteuid != 0
FILE_MODE=0644
FILE_CHOWN_ONLY=true
PARENT_DIRECTORY_CHOWN=false
```

### 4.1 Exact mode semantics

`0644` is a literal octal mode (`stat.S_IMODE == 0o644`) and means:

| Class | Bits | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| owner | `rw` | read and write |
| group | `r` | read only |
| other | `r` | read only |

After the privileged `chown`, the observable consequences are frozen as:

- an ordinary non-root reader can read the object;
- an ordinary reader cannot write the object;
- group and world write bits remain clear;
- the privileged owner may retain owner-write.

That last property is intentional. `0644` does not make the new owner
non-writable, and this contract MUST NOT claim that it does. The decisive guard
for the foreign-owner case is the owner policy at L110, which is exactly what
`0644` isolates: because `0o644 & 0o022 == 0`, the mutation policy at L111-L113
cannot fire, and because the attribute set is empty, the attribute policy at
L114-L117 cannot fire.

`0600` MUST NOT be used. With `0600` owned by another user, an ordinary
non-root reader cannot open the object at all, so the observed failure would be
a read-permission artifact rather than the owner-policy rejection the case
claims; for the root-owned case it would make the required admission
unreachable. `FILE_MODE=0644` is therefore a correctness requirement of both
cases, not a convenience.

### 4.2 Frozen mutation scope

Ownership mutation is confined to the single fixture file:

```text
FILE_CHOWN_ONLY=true
PARENT_DIRECTORY_CHOWN=false
```

The parent directory stays invocation-owned by the ordinary runner. This keeps
ancestor traversal authority with the ordinary process, so a failure can never
be explained by traversal denial, and it keeps the privileged mutation set as
small as the case allows.

The invocation-specific root and fixture parent MUST also be created with group
and world write bits clear (`mode & 0o022 == 0`, for example `0700`), so
ancestor admission goes through the ordinary non-writable path at L111-L113
rather than through the sticky-directory ancestor exception at L112. This
contract neither widens that exception nor depends on it, and no fixture step
may chmod an ancestor to make a case settle.

No fixture step may chown, chmod, ACL, or otherwise repair any object outside
the invocation-specific fixture directory, and no repository, worktree, cache,
runtime-data or pre-existing host path may be touched.

### 4.3 Required paired real controls

Both cases are real-kernel evidence. Before the production call is made, the
future privileged fixture MUST establish and record all of the following real
controls, and MUST record the measured values rather than asserting them from
expectation:

```text
CONTROL_geteuid_ne_target_uid=true
CONTROL_lstat_st_uid_eq_target_uid=true
CONTROL_mode_eq_0644=true
CONTROL_mode_and_0o022_eq_0=true
CONTROL_real_os_open_O_RDONLY_succeeds=true
```

The last control is the attribution guard. `_LinuxObject.__init__` calls
`os.lstat` and `os.open` (L127-L133) *before* `_facts()` reaches the owner
policy, so without a proven successful ordinary `os.open(O_RDONLY)`, a
failure could be an `EACCES` artifact of mode or traversal rather than the
owner-policy rejection under test. The implementation may additionally mirror
the production flag set (`O_RDONLY|O_NOFOLLOW|O_CLOEXEC|O_NONBLOCK`, L130); the
plain `O_RDONLY` control is the frozen minimum.

Two further real preconditions are required because other production guards sit
on the same path and would otherwise be indistinguishable from the owner
policy:

```text
FIXTURE_REGULAR_SINGLE_LINK_FILE=true      # L145 requires st_nlink == 1
FIXTURE_XATTR_AND_ACL_SET_EMPTY=true       # L114-L117 reject any attribute
```

If either precondition cannot be established, the case outcome is
`QUALIFICATION_GAP`, never a pass and never a product defect.

### 4.4 Frozen case outcomes

FOREIGN_OWNER. The target uid is nonzero and differs from the ordinary
reader's effective uid, so `st_uid in (0, os.geteuid())` is false. Production
MUST fail specifically with:

```text
reason_code=UNSAFE_PATH
detail contains "untrusted Linux object owner"
```

The observation point is `_linux._LinuxObject(path, directory=False)`, which
raises during construction on the path L135 (`_facts()`) -> L146
(`_permissions(...)`) -> L110 (owner guard). A wrong reason code, a wrong
detail, a successful construction, or an `OSError` in place of the contract
error is a failure of the case.

ROOT_OWNED. The target uid is exactly 0 while the ordinary reader's effective
uid is not 0. Production MUST admit the object and the retained security tuple
MUST report the literal root owner:

```text
target_uid=0
ordinary_reader_euid_ne_0=true
production_admits=true
held.security[0] == 0
```

`security` is the retained `(st_uid, st_gid, S_IMODE(st_mode), attributes)` tuple
produced by `_permissions` (L118) and retained by `_LinuxObject._facts()`
(L146); `security[0]` is therefore the literal `st_uid`. The case also proves
that the privileged owner's owner-write bit did not by itself cause a refusal,
which is the mode-semantics correction above.

The relaxed `_ownership_fixture` fallback in the ordinary suite stays exactly
as it is: an ordinary test that cannot chown records a gap. The privileged
fixture does not replace it, does not edit it, and does not convert its gap
into a pass.

## 5. Freeze: Privilege Boundary

The ordinary pytest/evidence process remains non-root. Privilege is used only
by a separately invoked fixed helper, and only for:

- setup ownership mutation (`chown` of the single fixture file);
- cleanup ownership restoration and removal of the invocation-specific fixture
  root;
- the RQP-L17 mount operations that cannot be performed without
  `CAP_SYS_ADMIN`.

No privilege is granted to ordinary pytest, and no fixture case may run its
production call in a privileged process. The production primitive under
qualification is always executed by the non-root evidence process.

A privileged helper MUST:

- operate only beneath one invocation-specific root under `RUNNER_TEMP`;
- open and validate that root before any mutation;
- reject symlink final components;
- reject absolute child names;
- reject `..`;
- reject multi-component child names;
- reject repository and worktree paths;
- reject runtime-data paths (`data/`, `catalog/`, `manifests/`, `reports/` and
  their configured equivalents);
- reject unexpected owner or mode state;
- fail closed on cleanup failure.

The helper is invoked with a fixed argument vector. It MUST NOT accept a
caller-supplied path, a caller-supplied uid, a caller-supplied mode, a
caller-supplied command, a shell fragment, an inherited descriptor, or
environment-provided authority.

### 5.1 No fd-passing requirement

File-descriptor passing across the `sudo` boundary is NOT an accepted
requirement of this contract and MUST NOT be frozen as one. `sudo` commonly
closes nonstandard descriptors, so "the directory descriptor crosses the sudo
boundary" is not currently provable. The implementation may instead reopen the
fixed `RUNNER_TEMP` root safely inside the privileged helper and operate
relative to its own validated descriptor. Either way, the helper revalidates the
root itself; it never trusts inherited state.

### 5.2 Privileged-boundary model

The fixture spans a privilege boundary, so the boundary is modeled explicitly.
Every fact that crosses it is exactly one of the following.

| Fact | Classification | Carrier and lifetime | Closing checkpoint |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Invocation root path, fixture child names, target uid, required mode | `EXPLICITLY_HANDED_OFF` | fixed helper argument vector, valid for one helper invocation | helper validates root, owner, mode and child name before mutating |
| Fixture ownership and mode after `chown` | `INDEPENDENTLY_REACQUIRED` | ordinary evidence process re-derives them with its own `lstat` and `os.open` | paired controls in 4.3 must all hold before the production call |
| Helper exit status | `INDEPENDENTLY_REACQUIRED` | process status, informational only | never evidence; the ordinary process reacquires the state itself |
| Mount namespace and its mounts | `INHERITED` within the private namespace only | shared by helper and evidence process; destroyed at namespace exit | explicit checked cleanup before exit; namespace exit is a second boundary, not a substitute |
| Host mount namespace | neither inherited nor handed off | no fact crosses; propagation is private/slave before any mutation | host-namespace absence control in section 10 |

The helper's own report is not evidence. If the ordinary process cannot
independently reacquire the state the helper claims to have produced, the case
is a `QUALIFICATION_GAP`.

### 5.3 Failure-origin classification

Every non-pass outcome is classified by origin before it is reported:

| Origin | Meaning for these cases |
| --- | --- |
| `PRODUCT_FAILURE` | the production guard produced the wrong reason, the wrong detail, or the wrong admission after every fixture control held |
| `TEST_FAILURE` | the privileged fixture asserted something it did not measure, or measured the wrong object |
| `ENVIRONMENT_FAILURE` | privilege, capabilities, kernel, tools, filesystem or runner constraints prevented a real fixture |
| `TOOLING_FAILURE` | the helper, shim, workflow or evidence transport malfunctioned without product causality |

An `ENVIRONMENT_FAILURE` or `TOOLING_FAILURE` is never rewritten as a product
defect, and a `PRODUCT_FAILURE` is never excused as an environment artifact.

## 6. Freeze: Privileged CI Architecture

```text
PRIMARY_RUNNER=ubuntu-latest
```

Rationale: the standard GitHub-hosted Ubuntu image runs as a VM and supports
passwordless `sudo`, which is what a real privilege fixture needs.

```text
SELF_HOSTED_REQUIRED=false
SELF_HOSTED_ADOPTION=preflight_demonstrated_fallback_only
```

`SELF_HOSTED_REQUIRED=true` is explicitly NOT frozen. Self-hosted execution is
a fallback only: it may be adopted only if the future implementation preflight
demonstrates that the standard runner cannot construct the required real
fixture, and that finding must be recorded before any self-hosted design is
frozen.

Privileged qualification is a NEW SEPARATE WORKFLOW:

```text
PRIVILEGED_WORKFLOW=.github/workflows/l4_privileged_qualification.yml
```

The existing workflow MUST retain its exact formal topology:

```text
FORMAL_CI_JOBS=test,portability-pyarrow24,package
FOURTH_FORMAL_JOB_AUTHORIZED=false
```

No fourth formal job may be added to `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, and the
privileged workflow is separate control-plane evidence rather than a formal
required check. It MUST NOT be inserted into the ordinary tier logic, and its
existence MUST NOT change any ordinary tier decision. Adding it is a
control-plane change that requires its own authorization, which this design PR
does not grant.

## 7. Freeze: Future Privileged Preflight

Before any mutation, the future implementation workflow MUST prove, from real
observed host state:

| Proof | Required observation |
| --- | --- |
| standard runner | the runner is the standard `ubuntu-latest` VM image, with image identity recorded |
| ordinary privilege | the ordinary evidence process has `euid != 0` |
| passwordless sudo | `sudo -n` succeeds without a prompt or terminal |
| helper privilege | the privileged child really reports `euid == 0` |
| capabilities | the privileged child's `CapEff` contains every capability this exact fixture needs, decoded from the real mask |
| kernel and tools | the required kernel interfaces and utilities exist and their versions are recorded |
| fixture root | the `RUNNER_TEMP` invocation root is usable, invocation-specific, and not a shared or persistent runner path |
| isolation | no persistent or shared runner state is targeted by any step |

The fixture's capability requirement is derived from the operations it really
performs: `CAP_CHOWN` for the RQP-L09 ownership mutation, and `CAP_SYS_ADMIN`
for the RQP-L17 private mount namespace, the loop-backed ext4 mount, the
`MNT_DETACH` detach and cleanup. `CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE` MUST NOT be required by the
design: `FILE_MODE=0644` exists precisely so the ordinary reader's access is a
real permissions fact rather than a capability artifact. A preflight that
passes only because a capability was assumed is invalid.

A failed preflight is classified by origin:

- `QUALIFICATION_GAP` when the required real fixture cannot be constructed in
  this environment;
- `ENVIRONMENT_FAILURE` when the environment itself failed to provide a
  documented runner property.

A failed preflight MUST never silently become `PASS`, and must never be
reported as a product failure. No mutation may occur after a failed preflight.

## 8. Freeze: RQP-L17 Row Semantics

The remaining RQP-L17 row is renamed and restated as:

```text
RQP_L17_HELD_MOUNT_REPRESENTATION_DRIFT
```

A3 does NOT prove a statx mount-id change. This contract MUST NOT state that A3
proves `_mount_id(fd)` measurement A != measurement B, and the existing
defensive invariant at L105 is not qualified by A3:

```text
L105_MOUNT_ID_CHANGE_REAL_TRIGGER=NOT_KNOWN_CONSTRUCTIBLE
```

L105 remains a defensive fail-closed invariant whose real trigger is not known
constructible with any reviewed mechanism. It stays in production unchanged and
unqualified; this design neither weakens it nor claims evidence for it.

What A3 does prove is a real topology change in the kernel's mount
representation of a mount that the evidence process still holds. The real
trigger is:

1. Retain a real descriptor to a qualifying ext4 mount, opened by the non-root
   evidence process with no privilege.
2. Before any drift, admit that descriptor once through the production
   primitive, so the positive case is real rather than assumed.
3. Detach that mount from the private namespace with `MNT_DETACH`.
4. Keep the descriptor open; never close it and never reopen by path.
5. Confirm the descriptor is still valid: `fstat` succeeds, the device and
   inode are unchanged, the retained bytes still read back unchanged, and
   `_mount_id(fd)` still returns the same nonzero mount id under `statx`.
6. Confirm from real `/proc/self/mountinfo` that the namespace no longer
   represents that mount: zero records carry the held mount id.
7. Call the production primitive again; `_mount_description` receives the real
   mount table, its `matches` tuple is empty, and the guard at L84-L85 fires.
8. Require exactly:

```text
reason_code=PLATFORM_UNQUALIFIED
detail="held mount missing or ambiguous"
```

`str(exc)` is therefore exactly
`PLATFORM_UNQUALIFIED: held mount missing or ambiguous`.

The paired control in step 2 is mandatory. Without a real positive admission
before the detach, a failure after the detach could be a construction artifact
of the fixture rather than the representation loss this case claims. Steps 5
and 6 are the independent controls that make the failure attributable: they
prove the descriptor is alive and the mount table is the real one, so the only
changed fact is the kernel's representation of the held mount.

```text
RQP_L17_GUARD_DISCRIMINATION_REQUIRED=true
```

Guard discrimination is frozen as well. The case MUST establish which guard
fired. The required failure is L84-L85 (`PLATFORM_UNQUALIFIED`, detail
`held mount missing or ambiguous`). If the observed first failure is instead
L105 (`UNSAFE_PATH`, detail `mount identity drift`), then the kernel changed the
statx mount id across the detach and the observed mechanism differs from the
mechanism frozen here: that outcome is `QUALIFICATION_GAP` plus a design
finding against this document, and it is never a pass and never a product
defect. A case that cannot distinguish the two guards does not prove anything
and MUST NOT be reported as evidence.

## 9. Freeze: RQP-L17 Filesystem Fixture

Bind mounts are NOT accepted as the target ext4 fixture. Before any drift, the
fixture MUST already satisfy the existing production conditions of L88-L94:

```text
root field == "/"                      # record field 3 is exactly b"/"
filesystem type == ext4                # record field separator+1 is exactly b"ext4"
device represented exactly once        # the device appears in exactly one record
rw present                             # "rw" in mount options and in super options
ro absent                              # "ro" in neither option set
```

Those conditions come from production, not from this document. A bind mount
fails them structurally: its `root` field is the bound subdirectory rather than
`/`, and the underlying device then appears in more than one record, which the
exactly-once rule rejects.

Preferred future fixture: one ephemeral ext4 filesystem image, mounted exactly
once inside the private mount namespace. The design may use a sparse regular
image, `mkfs.ext4`, and a loop-backed mount. These operations are permitted
only in the future separately authorized privileged implementation; no such
operation is authorized by this design PR.

Frozen fixture obligations for that implementation:

- the image, the mountpoint, and every helper-visible path live beneath the one
  invocation-specific `RUNNER_TEMP` root;
- the mount table is verified with the production predicate itself, not with a
  hand-written expectation: the retained descriptor must be admitted before the
  drift;
- the exactly-once device rule is verified against the real mount table,
  because runner images may already mount other loop-backed filesystems;
- the retained object is a regular single-link file that the ordinary non-root
  process can open read-only without privilege; its ownership is not RQP-L17
  evidence and must never be reported as RQP-L09 evidence;
- the fixture MUST NOT use the repository filesystem, a worktree, or any
  runtime-data path as the mutable mount fixture;
- any precondition that cannot be met is reported as `QUALIFICATION_GAP`, never
  as a product failure and never as a pass.

## 10. Freeze: Namespace Isolation

```text
RQP_L17_NAMESPACE_ISOLATION_REQUIRED=true
```

All mount and detach operations MUST occur in a private mount namespace.
Before any mutation, mount propagation MUST be made private/slave as
appropriate, so that no event can propagate back to the host namespace. The
fixture MUST never detach or remount the host root filesystem, and MUST never
use the repository filesystem itself as the mutable mount fixture.

Because a private mount namespace is what confines the mount events, the
ordinary evidence process and the privileged helper MUST share that one
private namespace: the mount namespace is inherited across `fork`, `exec` and
`sudo`, so a detach performed by the helper is observed by the evidence process
while the host namespace is untouched. A helper that created the fixture in a
namespace the evidence process cannot see would not satisfy this contract.

Namespace and process exit is a second cleanup boundary, not a substitute for
explicit checked cleanup. Before the privileged fixture exits it MUST, in
order: unmount the fixture inside the namespace, release the loop backing,
remove the invocation-specific root, and verify the resulting state. Cleanup
failure is reported as a distinct non-pass outcome (`CLEANUP_FAILED`) with the
residual path recorded as diagnostics only, and it MUST NOT be suppressed,
retried blindly, or converted into a pass.

The workflow MUST also record a host-namespace absence control: the fixture's
device and mountpoint MUST never appear in a mount table read from outside the
fixture namespace, before and after the run. That control is what makes "no
event reached the host namespace" an observed fact rather than an assumption.

## 11. Freeze: RQP-L17 Evidence Scope

The frozen scope is precisely:

A3 proves real-kernel fail-closed behavior of `_linux._ext4_capability(fd)` and
its real `_mount_description` path under held-mount representation loss.

A3 does NOT claim an end-to-end loop-mounted `_NativeScope(...)` proof. The
reason is structural: `_NativeScope.__init__` requires every retained ancestry
filesystem identity to match the root object's filesystem tuple
(`_physical.py` L37-L38, `UNSAFE_PATH` detail `ancestry mount/volume
transition`). A nested independent ext4 mount would fail that ancestry
mount/volume transition before the intended RQP-L17 mechanism could be reached,
so an end-to-end scope proof is a different contract with a different fixture.

Any future end-to-end scope proof requires a separate design. This document
does not authorize it, does not sketch it, and must not be cited as if it did.

## 12. Freeze: Future Test Placement and Ordinary-CI Separation

```text
FUTURE_PRIVILEGED_TEST_FILE=tests/privileged_schedule_artifact_qualification.py
```

The filename deliberately does NOT match the repository's normal pytest
auto-discovery pattern. With `testpaths = ["tests"]` and the default
`python_files = test_*.py` in `pyproject.toml`, a bare
`python -m pytest` cannot collect that file.

Frozen consequences:

- normal `python -m pytest` MUST NOT execute privileged fixture tests;
- the future privileged workflow invokes that file explicitly, by path;
- no `test_*.py` module may import the privileged file in a way that executes
  its privileged cases under ordinary collection;
- ordinary FULL semantics are preserved exactly, and ordinary CI is never
  converted into a privileged suite;
- the privileged workflow's own outcome is never a substitute for ordinary CI,
  and ordinary CI is never evidence for the privileged cases.

## 13. Future Implementation Surface

Expected later implementation files, with their expected change class:

| Path | Expected role |
| --- | --- |
| `docs/governance/l4_privileged_linux_qualification_v1.md` | this contract, already on base for the implementation PR |
| `tests/privileged_schedule_artifact_qualification.py` | explicitly invoked privileged qualification cases |
| `scripts/l4_privileged_fixture.py` | the fixed privileged helper (root validation, ownership mutation, mount setup/detach, checked cleanup) |
| `.github/workflows/l4_privileged_qualification.yml` | separate privileged qualification workflow with preflight and evidence publication |
| `scripts/check_release.py` | only as needed to pin and validate the new privileged workflow contract |

```text
FORMAL_CI_FILE_CHANGE_EXPECTED=false       # .github/workflows/ci.yml
PRODUCTION_SRC_CHANGE_EXPECTED=false       # src/**
CHECK_RELEASE_CHANGE_ONLY_FOR_WORKFLOW_PINNING=true
```

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` is EXPECTED UNCHANGED unless the implementation
proves a cross-workflow integration requirement that cannot be expressed
otherwise, and any such change is a separate authorization. Production
`src/**` is EXPECTED UNCHANGED: this design qualifies existing guards and
changes no reader, writer, platform or registry behavior.

Focused tests for the checker and workflow semantics may be added in the
implementation PR where they are needed to pin the new privileged workflow
contract.

## 14. Stage Separation and Registry Discipline

A3 privileged evidence closure MUST leave the production registry untouched:

```text
QUALIFIED_CAPABILITIES_AFTER_A3=frozenset()
CANDIDATE_TUPLE_ENROLLMENT=false
```

No candidate tuple may be enrolled by the privileged qualification work. The
L4 Linux tuple stays unadmitted, exactly as `_platform.py` L10 declares it, and
`tests/test_schedule_artifact_platform.py` keeps asserting that the production
registry is empty (L272-L276).

Stage order after A3 evidence closure:

```text
A3 privileged evidence closure
-> independent review of that evidence
-> separate A4 admission workstream
-> registry change only if explicitly authorized
```

The privileged qualification file may report that a real host produced an
admitting capability tuple. That report is review input for A4. It is not
admission: the registry change is a separate, separately authorized
production change with its own exact-tuple evidence and its own review.

## 15. Contract Implementability

These results are design implementability results, NOT qualification evidence.
They state that each frozen requirement can be produced, carried, observed and
consumed by the declared architecture.

```text
RQP_L09_FOREIGN_OWNER_IMPLEMENTABILITY=PASS
RQP_L09_ROOT_OWNED_IMPLEMENTABILITY=PASS
RQP_L17_HELD_MOUNT_REPRESENTATION_DRIFT_IMPLEMENTABILITY=PASS
RQP_L17_L105_MOUNT_ID_CHANGE_IMPLEMENTABILITY=NOT_CONSTRUCTIBLE_WITH_KNOWN_REAL_MECHANISM
A3_CONTRACT_IMPLEMENTABILITY=PASS
```

| Requirement | Authority owner | Required evidence | Producer | Carrier / holder | Lifetime | Consumer / verifier | Closing checkpoint | Failure outcome |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| RQP-L09 FOREIGN_OWNER rejection | repository design authority (this contract) | real foreign-owned file, all five paired controls, exact reason code and detail | privileged helper (setup) plus non-root evidence process (measurement) | captured privileged-workflow run output bound to the exact head and host identity | one run attempt, retained as CI evidence | independent reviewer; ordinary suite unchanged | all controls recorded and the production call observed failing for the owner policy | `QUALIFICATION_GAP` or `PRODUCT_FAILURE`, classified by origin |
| RQP-L09 ROOT_OWNED admission | same | real root-owned file, ordinary `euid != 0`, real open, `held.security[0] == 0` | same | same | same | same | positive admission plus literal `st_uid` observation | `QUALIFICATION_GAP` or `PRODUCT_FAILURE` |
| RQP-L17 representation drift | same | qualifying ext4 mount proof, pre-drift positive admission, post-detach live descriptor, real mount table, exact reason code and detail | privileged helper (mount, detach) plus non-root evidence process (primitive calls) | same | same | same | host-namespace absence control plus explicit checked cleanup recorded | `QUALIFICATION_GAP`, `ENVIRONMENT_FAILURE` or `PRODUCT_FAILURE` |
| RQP-L17 L105 mount-id change | same | a real repeatable trigger for a statx mount-id change on a held descriptor | none known | none | none | independent reviewer records non-constructibility | none; L105 stays defensive and unqualified | `NOT_CONSTRUCTIBLE_WITH_KNOWN_REAL_MECHANISM` |
| Registry admission | repository owner, via a later A4 authorization | exact-tuple evidence from a real qualified host, independently reviewed | future A4 workstream | production `_QUALIFIED_CAPABILITIES` after an authorized change | permanent until superseded by an authorized change | production reader admission path | A4 review and authorization | not attempted in A3; registry stays empty |

No requirement in this document depends on an evidence producer, carrier or
consumer that the declared architecture cannot provide. The two places where
continuity could have been assumed are handled explicitly instead: the helper's
exit status is never evidence (section 5.2), and no writer/reader evidence
handoff exists or is invented.

## 16. Three-Layer Consistency

| Invariant | HUMAN_CONTRACT (this document) | MACHINE_DECLARATION | RUNTIME | TESTS |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Foreign owner is refused by the owner policy | frozen, section 4.4 | none added; no registry entry exists for this case | `_permissions` L110 unchanged | ordinary gap case today; privileged real case later |
| Root ownership is admitted with a literal `st_uid` of 0 | frozen, section 4.4 | none added | `_permissions` L110 unchanged | ordinary gap case today; privileged real case later |
| Held-mount representation loss fails closed | frozen, sections 8 and 11 | none added | `_mount_description` L84-L85 unchanged | no existing test constructs it; privileged case later |
| L105 stays defensive and unqualified | frozen, section 8 | none | L105 unchanged | unchanged |
| No L4 tuple is admitted | frozen, section 14 | `_QUALIFIED_CAPABILITIES = frozenset()` | `_require_qualified` unchanged | `test_schedule_artifact_platform.py` L272-L276 unchanged |
| Ordinary pytest never runs privileged fixtures | frozen, section 12 | `pyproject.toml` collection scope unchanged | not applicable | privileged file not auto-discovered |
| Formal CI topology is unchanged | frozen, section 6 | `.github/workflows/ci.yml` unchanged | not applicable | unchanged |

This design does not claim that any layer is complete. The machine-declaration
layer is deliberately unchanged and empty, the runtime layer is deliberately
unchanged, and the privileged test layer does not yet exist. A green ordinary
suite is not evidence for any case frozen here.

## 17. Future-Implementation Preview

No production code is written by this PR. This is the required lightweight
preview of the later runtime work.

- Modules that will probably need modification: none in `src/**`. The helper
  and the privileged test file are new files under `scripts/` and `tests/`, and
  the workflow is new.
- Can existing APIs express the contract? Yes. The evidence process can import
  the existing private symbols `_linux._LinuxObject`, `_linux._ext4_capability`
  and `_linux._mount_id` exactly as the ordinary native-guard suite already
  does, and the case outcomes are expressed by the existing reason codes and
  details. No new public API is required.
- Can existing evidence and data structures carry all required facts? Yes: the
  retained security tuple, the mount description triple, the retained
  descriptor identity and the real mount table carry every fact the cases
  assert.
- Is new persistent state required? No. The fixture root is invocation-local
  under `RUNNER_TEMP` and is removed by checked cleanup.
- Is a cross-boundary handoff required? Yes, exactly one: the privilege
  boundary in section 5.2. It is explicit, bounded, revalidated by the
  ordinary process, and carries no authority.
- Is new public API or authority required? No. `_QUALIFIED_CAPABILITIES`
  remains the only L4 admission gate, and it stays empty.
- Can existing test seams prove the invariant? Yes for the ordinary suite; the
  privileged cases use the same private seams plus real privilege, and their
  evidence is published as workflow output rather than claimed by the ordinary
  suite.

If any of these answers stops being true during implementation, the
implementation PR MUST stop and return here rather than improvising authority.

## 18. Non-Goals

This design PR performs none of the following, and authorizes none of them:

```text
NO_PRIVILEGED_COMMAND=true
NO_SUDO_EXECUTION=true
NO_CHOWN=true
NO_MOUNT=true
NO_UMOUNT=true
NO_UNSHARE=true
NO_MKFS=true

NO_PRODUCTION_MODIFICATION=true
NO_REGISTRY_CHANGE=true
NO_TUPLE_ENROLLMENT=true
NO_WINDOWS_QUALIFICATION=true
NO_WRITER_OR_PUBLICATION_QUALIFICATION=true
```

Also out of scope: no workflow file is created or edited, no
`scripts/check_release.py` change, no destructive-operation contract or
exemption change, no version or dependency change, no release, tag, or
publication action, and no host, network, ACL or privilege configuration
change on any machine.

## 19. Validation for This Design PR

Validation is docs-governance scoped only:

- whitespace: `git diff --check` over the exact base-to-head range;
- repository hygiene: `python scripts/check_repo_hygiene.py`;
- destructive-operation design gate: `python scripts/check_destructive_design_gate.py
  --repo . --mode repository` (and the pull-request mode in CI);
- release checker: `python scripts/check_release.py`.

No FULL local pytest is run merely for this design document, and no privileged
command of any kind is executed by this PR. The ordinary suite is unchanged,
so its existing results remain the ordinary baseline.

## 20. Lifecycle and Stop

One design document, one commit, one DRAFT pull request, no amend, no force
push, no merge. The PR body states the design-only flags and this document is
its authority.

After the exact-head pull-request CI reaches a terminal conclusion, this
workstream stops and returns for independent review:

- terminal SUCCESS -> report the exact head SHA, head tree, changed-file set,
  contract implementability, PR number and state, and the exact CI run id,
  event, attempt and result, then stop;
- any terminal non-success -> report the actual workflow conclusion, the
  affected job or jobs, and the failing step when available, then stop.

Merge remains unauthorized. Implementation, privileged execution, CI workflow
change, production change and registry admission each remain separately
unauthorized by this document.
